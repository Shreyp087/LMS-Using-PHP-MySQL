## Introduction

The development of a Learning Management System (LMS) module that caters to both the end-users, i.e., the students and the admin, is a crucial requirement for effective learning. The LMS module is designed to provide the admin with all the necessary functionalities required to manage the system effectively, such as managing registered users, adding and deleting courses, and managing assignments and announcements. On the other hand, the student module offers functionalities like viewing courses, assignments, submitting assignments, downloading course policies, and viewing announcements. Both the admin and student modules provide basic functionalities like login and logout, and the student module also includes the functionality of registering for courses. Overall, the LMS module aims to provide a comprehensive platform for effective learning management.
